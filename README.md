## 📌 Notes

This project was originally built as a beginner-friendly frontend application to practice DOM manipulation, styling, and local storage. 
It served as the foundation for a later full-stack evolution, where features such as user authentication, cloud-based data storage, and multi-device synchronization were implemented in the upgraded version, **RhythmTasks**.

This early version reflects my learning process and progression from frontend fundamentals to building more complete, production-ready applications.
